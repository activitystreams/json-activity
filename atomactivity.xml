    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document presents an extension that allows activities on social
      objects to be expressed within <xref target="RFC4287">the Atom
      Syndication Format</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>The XML Namespaces URI [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] for the XML
      elements and attributes described in this specification is: <spanx
      style="verb">http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0</spanx>.</t>

      <t>In this document, the namespace prefix "activity:" is used for the
      above Namespace URI. The namespace prefix "atom:" is used for the
      namespace URI <spanx style="verb">http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom</spanx>.
      Note that the choices of namespace prefix are arbitrary and not
      semantically significant.</t>

      <t>This specification uses a shorthand form of terms from the XML
      Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204]. The phrase "Information Item" is
      omitted when naming Element and Attribute Information Items. Therefore,
      when this specification uses the term "element," it is referring to an
      Element Information Item in Infoset terms. Likewise, when this
      specification uses the term "attribute," it is referring to an Attribute
      Information Item.</t>

      <t>This specification allows the use of IRIs [RFC3987]. Every URI
      [RFC3986] is also an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever an IRI is named.
      When an IRI that is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST
      be mapped to a URI using the steps in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987]. When an
      IRI is serving as an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.</t>

      <t>Some sections of this specification are illustrated with a non-
      normative RELAX NG Compact schema [RELAXNG]. In those sections, this
      specification uses the atomCommonAttributes, atomMediaType, and atomURI
      patterns, defined in [RFC4287].</t>

      <t>However, the text of this specification provides the sole definition
      of conformance.</t>

      <t>This specification uses "the Atom specification" to refer to <xref
      target="RFC4287"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Activity Concepts">
      <t>For the purpose of this specification, an "activity" is a description
      of an action that was performed at some instant in time by some actor
      (the "subject"), usually on some social object (the "object"). An
      activity feed is therefore a feed of such activities.</t>

      <t>An activity may also have an "indirect object". The indirect object
      is considered for the purposes of this specification to be a modifier of
      the verb and does not exist as a first-class object.</t>

      <t>It is expected that in many cases consumers of feeds containing
      activity entries will use them to describe activities to the user as
      human-readable sentences such as "Joanne posted a Photo: 'My Cat'".
      However, the process for forming such sentences is not defined by this
      specification.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Verbs and Object Types">
      <t>Verbs and object types are identified by IRIs as defined by <xref
      target="RFC3987"></xref>. One verb identifier is defined by this
      specification in <xref target="postverb"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Other specifications may define further verb and object type IRIs.
      Such specifications MUST define the meaning of these IRIs, and SHOULD
      also describe how any additional properties of the verb or object type
      are to be encoded in an Atom entry.</t>

      <t>The properties of an object type are properties shared by all objects
      of that type. For example, a photo might have a property containing the
      URL of a thumbnail of the photo.</t>

      <t>The properties of a verb are modifiers of the verb, such as the
      indirect object of the activity.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="activityentries" title="Activity Entries">
      <t>An activity entry is an entry element as described by the Atom
      specification that represents an activity. The subject of the activity
      entry is the author of the entry. The verb and object of the activity
      are identified explicitly in the activity entry as described in the
      following sections.</t>

      <section anchor="titlesummarydetail"
               title="Activity Title, Summary and Detail">
        <t>In an activity entry, the atom:title, atom:summary and atom:content
        elements as described by <xref target="RFC4287"></xref> MUST contain a
        human-readable description of the activity. This text will be used by
        general Atom processors that do not understand the activity
        extensions. This text MAY also be used by activity feed processors
        that do not use a known verb.</t>

        <t>Activity feed producers MAY use information from outside sources to
        choose a suitable language to use for the action description. For
        example, an activity feed producer responding to an HTTP request might
        use the HTTP Accept-Language header or a user preference otherwise
        determined to select a language. Activity feed producers SHOULD use
        xml:lang as described in <xref target="RFC4287"></xref> Section 2 to
        identify the language used in these elements if they are able to
        determine the language used.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Time of the Activity">
        <t>The time that an activity occured is represented in the
        atom:published element within each Activity Entry. An Activity Entry
        MUST have exactly one atom:published element.</t>

        <t>Note well that the time stored herein is the time that the activity
        occured, <spanx>not</spanx> the time that the associated activity
        object was published. Feed processors MAY use this element to sort a
        list of Activity Entries into chronological order.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Activity Link">
        <t>An Activity Entry should include an atom:link element with a link
        relationship of "alternate", a type of "text/html" and a href
        attribute containing the URL of an HTML-based representation of this
        activity or the associated object. Though this link does not have any
        special significance in this specification, general Atom processors
        that do not support the activity extensions will often present such a
        link to the user.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The activity:verb Extension Element">
        <t>The presence of the activity:verb element in an atom:entry element
        indicates that the entry is an activity entry. All activity entries
        MUST have at least one activity:verb element.</t>

        <t>The content of the activity:verb element MUST be an IRI as defined
        by <xref target="RFC3987"></xref>. Note that the definition of IRI
        excludes relative references. Although the IRI might use a
        dereferencable scheme, processors must not assume that it can be
        dereferenced.</t>

        <t>The IRI within this element defines a verb for this action. A given
        activity entry MAY have more than one activity:verb element, which
        indicates that there are several verbs describing this activity. Where
        multiple verbs are used, all verbs MUST be generalizations or
        specializations of one another. For example, the general verb "to
        experience" might be specialized by a verb "to listen to".</t>

        <t>Activity feed processors SHOULD use the most specific verb that
        they understand within each entry. If none of the activity's verbs are
        understood by the processor, the processor MAY use other information
        to infer the verb, or the processor MAY use the content of the
        atom:title, atom:summary and/or atom:content to obtain a sentence
        describing the activity.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="activityobjectelement"
               title="The activity:object Extension Element">
        <t>The activity:object element contains information about the object
        of the activity. The content model of activity:object is identical to
        that of atom:entry when used in an object entry as described in <xref
        target="objectentries"></xref>.</t>

        <t>activity:object MUST contain an atom:id element. If this object is
        also published in an Object Entry, the atom:id value MUST be the same
        as in the Object Entry.</t>

        <t>activity:object SHOULD contain an atom:title element, which MAY be
        used by feed processors to identify the object to the user, for
        example as the text of a link to the HTML representation of the
        object.</t>

        <t>activity:object SHOULD also contain an atom:link element with a
        link relationship of "alternate" and the type "text/html", with the
        href attribute containing the URL of the HTML representation of the
        object if available.</t>

        <t>activity:object MAY also contain an atom:source element describing
        the object feed where this object resides, if any. Processors MAY use
        this information to give context to the activity. For example, if the
        source feed has a title of "Claire's Weblog", a processor may include
        the text "in Claire's Weblog" at the end of a sentence describing the
        activity to the user.</t>

        <t>All other elements included in activity:object SHOULD reflect
        elements in the Object Entry for this object, if one exists.</t>

        <t>An Activity Entry and its associated Object Entry MUST NOT share
        the same atom:id value.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="objectentries" title="Object Entries">
      <t>An Object Entry is an entry element as described by the Atom
      specification that represents the object of an activity. Any entry that
      is not an Activity Entry as described in <xref
      target="activityentries"></xref> is considered an Object Entry by this
      specification.</t>

      <section anchor="objecttypeelement"
               title="The activity:object-type Extension Element">
        <t>The content of the activity:verb element MUST be an IRI as defined
        by <xref target="RFC3987"></xref>. Note that the definition of IRI
        excludes relative references. Although the IRI might use a
        dereferencable scheme, processors must not assume that it can be
        dereferenced.</t>

        <t>The IRI within this element defines the type of the object
        described by this Object Entry. A given Object Entry MAY have more
        than one activity:object-type element, which indicates that this
        object has several types. Where multiple types are used, all types
        MUST be generalizaions or specializations of one another. For example,
        the general type "web page" might be specialized by a type "weblog
        entry".</t>

        <t>An Object Entry SHOULD have at least one activity:object-type
        element.</t>

        <t>Activity feed processors SHOULD use the most specific object type
        that they understand within each entry. If none of the activity's
        types are understood by the processor, the processor MAY use other
        information to infer the type, or the processor MAY act as if no
        activity:object-type element is present.</t>

        <t>If no activity:object-type element is present, the object has no
        defined type. Processors SHOULD refer to such objects only by their
        titles. For example, when forming an activity sentence a processor
        might say "Johan posted 'My Cat'" rather than "Johan posted a photo:
        'My Cat'".</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="impliedpost" title="Implied Post Activity">
        <t>When used alone, outside of the context of an explicit Activity
        Entry, an Object Entry has an implied 'post' activity. The implied
        Activity Entry for an Object Entry is constructed as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Create an empty atom:entry element. This is the Activity Entry
            element.</t>

            <t>Insert into the Activity Entry element a new activity:verb
            element containing the IRI of the post verb as described in <xref
            target="postverb"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Copy the atom:published element from the Object Entry element
            into the Activity Entry element.</t>

            <t>Insert into the Activity Entry element a new activity:object
            element.</t>

            <t>Do a deep copy of all child elements of the Object Entry
            element into the activity:object element, making sure to preserve
            all XML namespaces.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Processors SHOULD generate suitable human-readable descriptions of
        the action and insert them as described in <xref
        target="titlesummarydetail"></xref>.</t>

        <t>If the resulting entry will be published, generators SHOULD
        generate values for all other elements that the Atom specification
        requires as children of atom:entry. In particular, an atom:id value
        SHOULD be generated; this value MUST NOT be the same as that of the
        Object Entry.</t>

        <t>If the resulting entry is to be published, generators MAY omit
        elements from the generated activity:object element to reduce
        overhead. Such generators SHOULD bear in mind the requirements in
        <xref target="activityobjectelement"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Activity Feeds">
      <t>This specification defines no extensions to the atom:feed element as
      defined by the Atom specification. Therefore an Activity Feed is simply
      a standard Atom feed which contains only Activity Entries. Processors
      MAY create an Activity Entry representing the implied post activity of
      an Object Entry (see <xref target="impliedpost"></xref>) in order to
      synthesize an Activity Feed from a traditional Atom feed.</t>

      <section title="A Note about Legacy Feeds">
        <t>This section is non-normative.</t>

        <t>The implied post activity as described in <xref
        target="impliedpost"></xref>, along with the advice about untyped
        object entries in <xref target="objectentries"></xref>, are together
        intended to provide a mechanism for processing traditional
        non-activity Atom feeds as Activity Feeds. At the time of writing this
        specification, most such feeds serve to describe the activity of
        posting an item such as a weblog entry or a photo.</t>

        <t>It is acknowledged, however, that there do exist feeds that have
        other meanings, such as a list of a particular user's "favorite"
        objects. When applying the advice for processing feeds without
        activity extensions to such feeds, a processor will of course
        mis-interpret the nature of the activity. However, in practice it
        seems that most feeds of this kind include something in the title
        indicating their nature, so rendering such a mis-interpreted activity
        to a sentence will lead to something such as <spanx>Joe posted "Funny Cats" in "Joe's Favorite Videos"</spanx>,
        which is while not ideal an acceptable result in situations where
        activities are primarily for human consumption.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="postverb" title="The 'post' Verb">
      <t>This specification defines a single verb, which has the IRI <spanx
      style="verb">http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/post</spanx>.</t>

      <t>This verb describes the act of posting or publishing an object on the
      web. The implication is that before this activity occured the object was
      not posted, and after the activity has occured it <spanx>is</spanx>
      posted or published.</t>

      <t>This verb is used when creating the implied post activity for a
      standalone Object Entry. It MAY also be used as the value of
      activity:verb in an explicit Activity Entry.</t>

      <t>In an Activity Entry which has the 'post' verb, the value of the
      atom:published element SHOULD be the same as the atom:published element
      in the associated Object Entry.</t>

      <t>The 'post' verb has no additional properties or modifiers.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>As this specification defines an extension to the Atom Syndication
      Format, it is subject to the same security considerations defined in
      <xref target="RFC4287"></xref>.</t>
